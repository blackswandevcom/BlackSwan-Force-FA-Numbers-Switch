# BlackSwan Force FA-Numbers Switch

**BlackSwan Force FA-Numbers Switch** is an AutoIt script that replaces English and Persian digits when typing on the Numpad. It includes a system tray icon with toggling functionality, allowing users to easily enable or disable the digit replacement feature. The script also supports switching between Persian and English number input using a custom hotkey (Ctrl+NumpadDot).

## Features

- **Persian Digit Replacement**: Replaces Numpad digits (0-9) with their Persian equivalents.
- **Toggle Functionality**: Easily enable or disable the digit replacement feature using a system tray icon or a hotkey.
- **Custom Tray Icon**: The system tray icon changes color and text based on the toggle state.
- **Hotkey Support**: Use `Ctrl + Numpad Dot (.)` to toggle the digit replacement feature.

### Edit and Compile the Script Yourself

   git clone https://github.com/blackswanlab/BlackSwan-Force-FA-Numbers-Switch.git


## Usage

  - Click on the system tray icon to toggle the digit replacement feature on and off.
  - The tray icon will display "En" with a white background when enabled and "Fa" with a yellow background when disabled.

- **Hotkey for Toggle**:
  - Press `Ctrl + Numpad Dot (.)` to toggle the digit replacement feature on or off.

- **About Dialog**:

## Keybindings

- **Numpad 0-9**: Replaced with Persian digits (۰-۹) when the feature is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- **Persian Digits Not Displaying**: Ensure you use a text editor or application supporting Persian digits and Unicode. I think you should consider using Microsoft Word for better Unicode support.
- **Tray Icon Not Updating**: If the system tray icon does not update correctly, try restarting the script.
